## 1. The Problem (Deep Dive)

### The Blank Card Moment

**6.5 billion greeting cards are purchased in the US annually.** Every single one needs a message.

The moment people dread isn't buying the card - it's opening it and staring at the blank space. "What do I write?" They know what they feel. They don't know how to say it.

### Why This Is Hard

Research on sympathy card writing reveals consistent anxiety patterns:

| Pain Point | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| "Don't know what to say" | Google: 110K+ monthly searches for "what to write in sympathy card" |
| Fear of clichés | Articles explicitly warn against "they're in a better place" |
| Cultural/religious sensitivity | Users anxious about assumptions |
| Relationship calibration | Different for coworker vs. close friend |
| Time pressure | Cards often written last-minute |

### The Sympathy Card Problem (Worst Case)

Sympathy cards represent the hardest writing challenge:
- Highest emotional stakes
- No room for generic messages
- Fear of saying the wrong thing
- Often needed urgently (funeral tomorrow)

**Quote from Hallmark**: "While there is no perfect message, expressing your support is crucial."

This is exactly where Prosepal shines - we remove the paralysis.

### Current Solutions Fail

| Solution | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Requires prompt engineering: "Write a sympathy message for my aunt who lost her husband of 40 years, keep it warm but not religious, mention his love of gardening..." |
| **Grammarly** | Edits existing text, doesn't generate from scratch |
| **Google** | Returns generic lists, no personalization |
| **Card design apps** | Beautiful images, empty message box |
| **Wing it** | Results show - recipients can tell |

### Key Insight: UK Is The Most Valuable Market Per-Capita

The UK spends **7x more on greeting cards relative to GDP** than the USA:
- **94% of British adults** buy greeting cards (vs 53% in US)
- **30 cards per person/year** (vs 19 in US)
- UK market is **£1.5B** for 67M people; US is $2.4B for 335M people

**Strategic implication:** UK users have the highest card-buying habit in the world. Target them aggressively.

### Key Insight: Physical Declining, Digital Exploding

The physical card market is shrinking 2-3% annually. But online greeting services grew 18%+ CAGR over 5 years. **The message is separating from the medium.**

### Consumer Behavior Shifts

| Trend | Data Point |
|-------|------------|
| Customization demand | 58% of users prefer customizable e-cards |
| AI personalization growth | 39% YoY increase in AI personalization tool usage |
| Millennials buying MORE cards | 63% of 18-35 plan to send more cards this year |
| Digital fatigue driving physical | Younger generations returning to handwritten for authenticity |

### Key Insight: Millennials Are The Target

Millennials are the **largest card-buying generation** - they value authenticity but struggle with the message. Digitally native enough to use AI, but want it to feel personal.

## 6. Conversion & Monetization

### Industry Benchmarks (2025)

| Metric | Benchmark | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Install → Trial conversion | 10-20% | Statista |
| Trial → Paid conversion | 15-25% | RevenueCat |
| Direct paywall conversion | 2-5% | RevenueCat |
| Freemium → Paid | 0.7-4% | Various |
| Top 5% app first-year revenue | >$8,880 | RevenueCat |
| Bottom 25% first-year revenue | <$19 | RevenueCat |

### Prosepal Model: Freemium + Soft Paywall

**Free Tier**:
- 1 lifetime generation (no login)
- Experience the full flow
- See the magic work

**Pro Tier** ($4.99/month or $29.99/year):
- 500 generations/month (effectively unlimited)
- History saved across devices
- No ads, priority support

### Regional Pricing (App Store Tiers)

| Market | Monthly | Annual | Relative Value | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------|-------|
| **USA** | $4.99 | $29.99 | Baseline | Primary market |
| **UK** | £3.99 | £24.99 | Good value | Highest card culture - strong conversion expected |
| **Canada** | C$6.99 | C$39.99 | Standard | Second-tier Anglophone market |
| **Australia** | A$7.99 | A$44.99 | Standard | Strong iOS market share |
| **New Zealand** | NZ$8.99 | NZ$49.99 | Standard | Follows AU patterns |
| **Ireland** | €4.99 | €29.99 | Good value | Euro pricing, UK cultural spillover |

*App Store handles currency automatically via pricing tiers. These map to Tier 5 (monthly) and Tier 30 (annual).*

### Why This Model

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 free generation | Must experience value before paywall |
| Not 3 free | Creates urgency after first "aha" moment |
| $4.99/month | Below "impulse" threshold, matches utility apps |
| $29.99/year | ~50% discount, strong annual incentive |
| 500/month limit | Effectively unlimited for individuals, prevents API abuse |

### Conversion Optimization Levers

1. **Day-0 Activation**: 82% of trial conversions happen on install day
2. **Immediate Value**: First generation must work flawlessly
3. **Friction Removal**: No signup required for first generation
4. **Price Psychology**: Monthly feels expensive, annual feels like a deal
5. **Timing**: Show paywall after first successful generation (proven value)

### Revenue Projections (Conservative)

| Scenario | Monthly Downloads | Conversion | MRR |
|----------|-------------------|------------|-----|
| Month 1 | 1,500 | 2% | $150 |
| Month 6 | 15,000 | 3.5% | $2,625 |
| Month 12 | 30,000 | 4% | $6,000 |

## 7. App Store Optimization (ASO)

### Why ASO Matters

- 70% of App Store users discover apps through search
- Screenshots are the #1 conversion factor after icon
- Keywords determine visibility for intent-based searches

### Keyword Strategy

#### Primary Keywords (High Intent)

| Keyword | Search Volume | Competition |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| "greeting card message" | Medium | Low |
| "what to write in card" | High | Low |
| "card message ideas" | Medium | Low |
| "sympathy message" | High | Medium |
| "birthday card message" | High | Medium |

#### Seasonal Keywords (Rotate 2-3 weeks before peak)

**USA Keywords:**

| Season | Keywords |
|--------|----------|
| February | valentine message, valentine card, love message |
| May | mothers day card, mom message, mothers day message |
| June | fathers day card, graduation message, wedding card message |
| November | thanksgiving message, thank you card |
| December | christmas card message, holiday wishes, new year message |

**UK Keywords** (Note: Different dates!):

| Season | Keywords |
|--------|----------|
| February | valentine message, valentine card |
| **March** | **mothers day card, mum message, mothering sunday** |
| April | easter message, easter card |
| June | fathers day card, wedding card message |
| November | **remembrance day message, poppy day** |
| December | christmas card message, boxing day, new year message |

**Australia/NZ Keywords:**

| Season | Keywords |
|--------|----------|
| February | valentine message |
| April | easter message, **anzac day message** |
| **May** | **mothers day card** (AU/NZ) |
| **September** | **fathers day card** (AU/NZ - different from US/UK!) |
| December | christmas card message, boxing day |

> **Critical:** UK Mother's Day is in **March** (Mothering Sunday), not May. Australia/NZ Father's Day is in **September**, not June. Plan ASO keyword rotations accordingly.

### App Title & Subtitle

**Title** (30 chars): `Prosepal - Card Messages`

**Subtitle** (30 chars): `AI Greeting Card Writer`

### First Boost Strategy (Launch Week)

Use [Main Keyword] + [Unique App Name] to trigger App Store auto-suggestions:

**Prosepal Implementation**:
- Title: `Prosepal - Card Messages`
- Users searching "card message" may see Prosepal suggested
- Can yield 34-50 trials in first 1-2 weeks

**Checklist**:
- [x] Verify app name is unique (done)
- [x] Main keyword in title (done: "Card Messages")
- [ ] Launch ASO metadata 1-2 days before app goes live
- [ ] Monitor Search Ads keyword reports for suggestion triggers

### Screenshot Strategy

Research shows the first 3 screenshots are critical - users rarely scroll.

| Screenshot | Content | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Hero shot: "Never stare at a blank card again" + phone showing completed message | Hook + promise |
| 2 | Occasion picker (40 options visible) | Breadth |
| 3 | Before/after: blank card → beautiful message | Transformation |
| 4 | Relationship + tone selectors | Personalization |
| 5 | 3 message variations | Choice/quality |
| 6 | One-tap copy | Speed |

**Design Principles**:
- Benefit-driven captions, not feature names
- High contrast, readable on small screens
- Show real UI (builds trust)
- Consistent visual language
- Device frames optional (mixed data on effectiveness)

### App Description Structure

```
First Line (Visible Before Expand):

"Saved me at 3 funerals this year" - App Store Review
```

### Ratings Strategy

**When to Prompt** (Apple's SKStoreReviewController):
- After 3rd successful generation (proven value)
- After copying a message (completed action)
- NOT during first session
- NOT after errors
- Max 3x per 365 days (Apple limit)

**Best Practices**:
- Time prompt after positive moment
- Never interrupt active task
- Use native prompt (required by Apple)
- Don't ask "Do you like our app?" first (against guidelines)

## 8. Content Marketing

> **UPDATED January 2026:** Strategy shifted from TikTok grind to Search-first (SEO + Pinterest). 
> TikTok reduced to monthly AI-generated batches. See rationale in `EXPANSION_STRATEGY.md`.

### Platform Strategy (Revised)

| Platform | Content Type | Goal | Frequency |
|----------|--------------|------|-----------|
| **Programmatic SEO** | 20 occasion/relationship pages | Capture high-intent Google traffic | One-time build |
| Pinterest | Pins linking to SEO pages | Amplify SEO, visual search | 5-10 pins/week |
| TikTok | AI-generated clips (Dimitri-style) | Creative testing, ad assets | Monthly batch (8-12 clips) |
| Reddit | Genuine help, not promotion | Trust, long-tail | As relevant |

**Time Budget**: ~2-3 hours/week (reduced from 4-5)

### Programmatic SEO (Primary - NEW)

Build 20 high-intent landing pages at `prosepal.app/messages/[occasion]/[relationship]`.

**Why SEO over TikTok:**
- Catches users WITH pen in hand (high intent)
- Compounds over time (TikToks die in hours)
- No burnout risk
- Google traffic = free forever

**Page Structure (Avoid Thin Content):**
```
/messages/sympathy/coworker

3. `/messages/sympathy/parent`
4. `/messages/birthday/mom`
5. `/messages/birthday/dad`
6. `/messages/birthday/friend`
7. `/messages/thank-you/boss`
8. `/messages/thank-you/teacher`
9. `/messages/wedding/friend`
10. `/messages/wedding/sibling`
11. `/messages/baby/friend`
12. `/messages/get-well/coworker`
13. `/messages/retirement/boss`
14. `/messages/graduation/child`
15. `/messages/anniversary/parents`
16. `/messages/condolence/loss-of-parent`
17. `/messages/condolence/loss-of-spouse`
18. `/messages/apology/friend`
19. `/messages/encouragement/friend`
20. `/messages/farewell/coworker`

### AI Content Factory (Replaces TikTok Grind)

Use Dimitri-style AI pipeline to batch-create video content monthly:

```
Claude (script) → Nano Banana Pro (image) → ElevenLabs (voice) 
→ InfiniteTalk (lip-sync) → CapCut (captions)
```

**Process:**
- **Once/month:** 2-hour session
- **Output:** 8-12 clips
- **Schedule:** 2-3 posts/week via Buffer/Later
- **Purpose:** Creative testing + ad asset generation (NOT primary growth)

**Why this works:**
- ~8 min/video at ~$0 cost
- No burnout (not filming yourself)
- Consistent character = brand recognition
- Test messaging before spending on ads

### Video Ad Creative (For Paid + Organic)

Formats that work for a software app (not physical product):

**Platform Limits:**

| Platform | Max Length | Optimal |
|----------|------------|---------|
| YouTube Shorts | 60 sec | 30-45 sec |
| Instagram Reels | 90 sec | 15-30 sec |
| TikTok | 10 min | 15-45 sec |
| YouTube Ads | No limit | 15-30 sec |

**Best Formats for Prosepal:**

**1. The Blank Card Moment (POV) - 15-30 sec**
```
[0-3s] Camera looking down at blank card + pen
[3-8s] Hand reaches for phone, opens Prosepal
[8-18s] Quick app demo: occasion → relationship → tone → generate
[18-25s] Hand writes message on card
[25-30s] Card closes. Text: "Done in 30 seconds"
```

**2. The Transformation (Split Screen) - 15-20 sec**
```
[Left side] "What I would have written:"
           "Happy Birthday! Hope it's a good one!"

[Right side] "What Prosepal wrote:"
            [Beautiful personalized message with details]

[End] "Which one would YOU rather receive?"
```

**3. The Reaction (UGC-style) - 30-60 sec**
```
[0-5s] "I used AI to write my mom's birthday card"
[5-10s] Show app generating message
[10-15s] "Here's her reaction..."
[15-50s] Film mom reading, getting emotional
[50-60s] "Link in bio" / App Store badge
```

**4. Problem-Agitate-Solve - 30-45 sec**
```
[0-10s] "Every time I buy a card, I stand there for 10 minutes 
        trying to think of what to write..."
[10-20s] "I always end up with something generic like 
         'Thinking of you' and I hate it"
[20-35s] "Then I found this app..." [show demo]
[35-45s] "Now it takes 30 seconds and actually sounds like me"
```

**5. The Hook Test (Multiple 15-sec variations)**

Test different hooks with same demo footage:
- "POV: Your coworker's dad just died"
- "The app that writes your card messages"
- "Why your greeting cards sound so generic"
- "I spent $4 to never stare at a blank card again"

**Production Tips:**
- Screen record at 60fps for smooth scrolling
- Use iPhone screen recording (shows gestures)
- Add captions (85% watch muted)
- First 3 seconds = hook or scroll
- End with clear CTA (App Store badge)

**Workflow:**
1. Create 5 variations with different hooks
2. Post organically to test engagement
3. Top performer → boost with paid ads
4. Repeat monthly

### TikTok/Reels Strategy (Secondary - Legacy)

**Why TikTok**:
- 766M+ daily active users
- Algorithm favors content quality over follower count
- New accounts can go viral
- Perfect for "before/after" transformation content

**Content Pillars**:

| Pillar | Example | Hook |
|--------|---------|------|
| **The Struggle** | "POV: You bought a sympathy card and now you're having an existential crisis" | Relatable pain |
| **The Speed Run** | "Writing a card message in 30 seconds (not clickbait)" | Proof of speed |
| **The Transformation** | "What I would have written vs. what AI wrote" | Quality comparison |
| **The Niche** | "When your coworker's dog dies and you don't know what to say" | Specific scenarios |
| **The Reaction** | "My mom's reaction to the message I wrote her" | Emotional payoff |

**Video Formula** (Research-Backed):
1. Hook in first 1-3 seconds (text overlay + movement)
2. Jump cuts to maintain pace
3. Show the app naturally (not forced)
4. End with result + soft CTA
5. 15-45 seconds optimal length

**Viral Triggers**:
- Duet/stitch opportunities
- Relatable situations
- "Wait for it" payoffs
- Emotional moments
- Controversial takes ("Hallmark cards are lazy")

### Regional Content Hooks

**UK-Specific Content** (94% card penetration - huge opportunity):

| Hook | Example | Why It Works |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **British Problems** | "POV: You're in Tesco and the card aisle is chaos" | UK supermarket culture, relatable |
| **Emotional Reserve** | "British struggle: writing a sympathy card without being too emotional" | Cultural stereotype, humorous |
| **Mum vs Mom** | "When the AI knows to write 'Mum' not 'Mom'" | Localisation detail, builds trust |
| **Card Factory Queue** | "The Card Factory queue vs writing the message" | UK-specific retailer, instant recognition |
| **Mothering Sunday** | "Mothering Sunday is in 2 weeks and you haven't started" | UK-specific timing (March) |

**Australia/NZ-Specific Content**:

| Hook | Example | Why It Works |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **September Father's Day** | "When Americans wish you Happy Father's Day 3 months early" | AU/NZ date difference |
| **ANZAC Day** | "Writing to a veteran for ANZAC Day" | Emotional, culturally significant |
| **Tall Poppy** | "Writing a congratulations card without sounding like you're bragging for them" | Cultural syndrome reference |

**Canada-Specific Content**:

| Hook | Example | Why It Works |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Sorry Culture** | "Canadian problem: your sympathy card is 90% apologising" | National stereotype, humorous |
| **Bilingual** | "When you need both English and French versions" | Quebec market opportunity |

### UGC-to-Paid Funnel

Build organic content first, then scale winners via paid ads:

**Step 1: Organic Library (Weeks 1-8)**
- Post 5-7 TikToks/Reels per week
- Track: views, watch time, saves, shares
- Goal: 20+ videos with 5K+ views each

**Step 2: Identify Winners (Week 8+)**
- Select top 3-5 performers (highest engagement)
- Note patterns: hook style, length, CTA format

**Step 3: Scale via Paid (Month 4+)**
- Use winning organic content as ad creative
- Double spend on videos that maintain ROI

### Pinterest Strategy

**Why Pinterest**:
- 537M monthly active users
- Users have HIGH purchase intent (70% more likely to buy)
- Content has long lifespan (60%+ of saves are 1+ year old pins)
- Functions as visual search engine

**Content Types**:

| Pin Type | Example | Call-to-Action |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Message collections | "20 Birthday Messages That Actually Sound Personal" | "Generate your own →" |
| Occasion guides | "What to Write in a Sympathy Card (Without Clichés)" | "Get personalized message →" |
| Relationship tips | "Thank You Messages for Every Relationship" | "Try Prosepal →" |
| Seasonal roundups | "Valentine's Day Messages That Don't Sound Cheesy" | "Download free →" |

**Board Structure**:
- Birthday Card Messages
- Thank You Card Ideas
- Sympathy & Condolence Messages
- Wedding & Anniversary Wishes

- [Occasion] Card Ideas (for each occasion)

### Reddit Strategy

**Relevant Subreddits**:
- r/etiquette (266K members)
- r/relationships (8.7M members)
- r/socialskills (3.2M members)
- r/Advice (3.8M members)
- r/CasualConversation (1.8M members)

**Approach** (Critical - Reddit hates spam):
1. Find genuine "what do I write" posts
2. Provide helpful, specific advice
3. Mention Prosepal only if truly relevant
4. Build karma through genuine participation
5. Never astroturf or create fake posts

**Example Response**:
> "For a sympathy card, keep it simple and personal. Start with 'I'm so sorry for your loss,' mention something specific about the person if you can, and offer concrete support ('I'll bring dinner Thursday'). If you're really stuck, apps like Prosepal can help generate a starting point you can personalize."

### ChatGPT Ads (Emerging - Monitor Closely)

> **Status**: Testing began January 2026 in US. Self-serve NOT yet available.
> **Last Updated**: January 2026

#### Why This Matters for Prosepal

Users literally ask ChatGPT: "Help me write a sympathy card message" - this is **100% intent match** with our product. The marketing doc already identifies ChatGPT as an indirect competitor ("requires prompt engineering"). Advertising at the moment of that friction is strategically perfect.

#### Current State

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Launch | Testing in "coming weeks" (Jan 2026) |
| Who sees ads | Free + Go ($8/mo) tiers only |
| Ad format | Bottom of response, clearly labeled, contextual |
| Pricing | NOT disclosed - CPM/CPC unknown |
| Advertiser access | NO sign-up available yet |
| Targeting | Semantic intent matching (not keywords) |
| User base | 800M weekly active users |

#### The Facebook 2007 Parallel

Analysts compare this to Facebook's early ad era (2007-2008): massive user base, nascent ad platform, low competition, cheap inventory. Early movers on Facebook saw outsized ROI before big budgets flooded in.

**What's similar**: Huge engaged user base, contextual targeting, low initial competition.

**What's different**: No self-serve ads yet, pricing unknown, Google/Meta preparing responses.

**Verdict**: Opportunity is real, but window may be shorter and less accessible than the Facebook analogy suggests.

#### Strategic Fit

| Factor | Prosepal Alignment |
|--------|-------------------|
| Intent match | 100% - users ask exactly what we solve |
| Conversion potential | AI-referred traffic converts 4-5x higher than search |
| Competition | Currently zero in greeting card AI category |
| Positioning | We're the "solution" to ChatGPT's friction |

#### Action Plan

**Immediate (Now)**:
- [ ] Monitor OpenAI announcements weekly
- [ ] Bookmark: [openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising](https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/)
- [ ] Subscribe to SearchEngineLand, Digiday for early access news
- [ ] Track ChatGPT referral traffic (add UTM detection for `chat.openai.com`)

**Before Ads Available**:
- [ ] Build organic ChatGPT citations via prosepal.app/blog content
- [ ] Structure FAQ/how-to content that AI models cite
- [ ] Ensure brand is mentioned in AI training data (PR, content)

**When Self-Serve Opens**:
- Budget: $100-200 initial test (exception to $1K MRR rule due to early-mover window)
- Target intents: "sympathy card," "birthday message," "thank you note"
- Success criteria: CPI < $1.50 (better than ASA)
- Compare against Apple Search Ads baseline

#### Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Timing | Advertiser Access |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Testing | Q1 2026 (now) | Major brands only (likely) |
| Limited rollout | Q2-Q3 2026 | Expanded, possibly self-serve |
| General availability | Q4 2026+ | Self-serve for all |

#### Priority vs Other Channels

1. **Apple Search Ads** - Available now, high intent, use $199 credit
2. **ChatGPT Ads** - When available, potentially higher intent, move fast
3. **Google Ads** - Proven but requires more budget
4. **Meta Ads** - Last, needs UGC library

---

### Google Ads (Month 4+)

**Why Google Ads First**:
- Best ROI among paid channels per indie dev consensus
- Lower learning curve than Meta
- AI features automate optimization
- Master one channel before expanding

**Campaign Structure**:

| Campaign Type | Targeting | Budget | Goal |
|---------------|-----------|--------|------|
| US campaigns | USA only | $50/day | Higher LTV, better monetization |
| Worldwide campaigns | All English markets | $30/day | Volume, cheaper installs |

**Best Practices**:
- Test patiently - algorithms need 2-4 weeks learning
- Use AI-powered features (Performance Max, Smart Bidding)
- Connect Firebase events for conversion signals
- Start at $50-80/day, scale winners to $150+/day

**Tracking**:
- Connect Google Ads to Firebase Analytics
- Track: install → trial → paid events
- No complex MMPs needed - Firebase + RevenueCat sufficient

### Meta Ads (Month 6+)

**Prerequisites** (don't start until these are met):
- Google Ads profitable (positive ROAS)
- 100+ App Store reviews
- UGC library of 20+ videos with engagement data

**Audience Targeting**:

| Audience | Targeting |
|----------|-----------|
| Core | Interests: Hallmark, Papyrus, American Greetings |
| Behavioral | Recently engaged, new parents, recent move |
| Lookalike | 1% of Google Ads converters |
| Retargeting | Installed but not purchased |

**Creative Approach**:
- Use proven organic UGC as ad creative
- "POV" format performs best
- Budget: $100+/day for learning phase

### Influencer Marketing (Month 6+)

**Ideal Influencers**:
- Lifestyle/organization creators
- Stationery/journaling community
- Wedding/event planners
- Grief counselors/therapists
- Working moms

**Compensation Models**:
| Size | Followers | Rate | Approach |
|------|-----------|------|----------|
| Nano | 1K-10K | Free product | Volume |
| Micro | 10K-100K | $100-500 | Authenticity |
| Mid | 100K-500K | $500-2K | Reach |

### Channels to Skip or Delay

Based on indie dev experience, avoid these initially:

| Channel | Why Skip | When to Reconsider |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Meta/Facebook Ads** | Higher learning curve than Google Ads; master one paid channel first | After Google Ads profitable |
| **Micro-influencers (paid)** | 2-3x pricing inflation in 2025-26; mixed ROI results | Only if hyper-targeted to card/stationery niche |
| **Complex tracking (Adjust/AppsFlyer)** | Overkill for indie scale; Firebase + RevenueCat sufficient | Never for single-app portfolio |
| **LinkedIn/Twitter Ads** | Wrong audience, high CPM | Skip unless B2B pivot |
| **Web SEO without AI assist** | Traditional SEO takes 6-12 months with no guarantee | Viable with AI batch content (your current approach) |

**Mindset**: Master one channel before expanding. Better to own 100% of one channel than 20% of five.

## 10. Retention & Engagement

### Why Retention Matters

- 30% of annual subscriptions cancel in Month 1
- Acquisition costs are rising; retention is cheaper
- Power users drive word-of-mouth

### Onboarding Optimization

**Research-Backed Principles**:
1. **Progressive disclosure**: Don't show everything at once
2. **Immediate value**: First generation must succeed
3. **Minimal friction**: No signup for first use
4. **Clear progress**: User knows where they are

**Prosepal Onboarding Flow**:

| Step | Screen | Goal |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Splash + one-liner | Set expectation |
| 2 | Occasion picker | Easy first choice |
| 3 | Relationship picker | Personalization begins |
| 4 | Tone selector | Control feeling |
| 5 | Details (optional) | Deeper personalization |
| 6 | Generation | Magic moment |
| 7 | Results | Deliver value |
| 8 | Copy | Complete action |
| 9 | (Post-success) Paywall | Convert |

**Key Metric**: Time to first successful copy < 60 seconds

### Retention Triggers

| Trigger | Timing | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Unused after install | Day 1 | Push: "Your first card message is waiting" |
| Single use then dormant | Day 3 | Push: "Thank someone today?" |
| Seasonal reminder | 2 weeks before holiday | Push: "[Holiday] cards coming up" |
| Birthday reminder | If enabled | Push: "[Name]'s birthday is tomorrow" |
| Streak recognition | After 3 uses | In-app: "You're getting good at this" |

### Push Notification Strategy

**Principles**:
- Value-driven, not nag-driven
- Tied to external events (holidays, birthdays)
- Respect opt-outs
- Test timing (evenings often best)

**Examples**:
- "Mother's Day is in 2 weeks. Get ahead of the card aisle panic."
- "Haven't thanked someone in a while? 30 seconds is all it takes."
- "Difficult card to write? We've helped with 10,000 sympathy messages."

## 13. AI-Powered Execution Playbook

> **Philosophy**: AI is your virtual marketing team. Claude and other LLMs handle 80% of content creation, analysis, and iteration—you provide direction and final approval.

### Why This Works for Solo Founders

| Traditional Approach | AI-Powered Approach |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Hire freelance copywriter ($500+) | Batch-generate with Claude (free) |
| Agency for ad creative ($2K+/mo) | Generate 50 variants in one session |
| SEO consultant ($1K+/mo) | AI writes optimized blog posts |
| Social media manager ($1.5K+/mo) | Batch content + scheduling tools |

**Trade-off**: More of your time upfront, but full control, faster iteration, and dramatically lower cost. Many indie devs in 2025-2026 are hitting $1K-10K/mo this way.

### The Batch Content Workflow

**Core principle**: Don't context-switch. Batch your AI sessions into focused 1-2 hour blocks.

| Session Type | Frequency | Output |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| Content generation | Weekly (Monday) | Week's TikToks, pins, posts |
| Analytics review | Weekly (Sunday) | Insights fed back to AI |

| "What to Write in a Sympathy Card: 50 Thoughtful Examples" | what to write in sympathy card | High intent, 110K+ monthly |
| "Birthday Card Messages That Don't Sound Generic" | birthday card message ideas | High volume |
| "Thank You Card Wording for Every Situation" | thank you card wording | Medium volume |
| "How to Write a Wedding Card Message (With Examples)" | wedding card message | Seasonal spikes |
| "Graduation Card Messages They'll Actually Remember" | graduation card message | May-June spike |

**Blog Post Prompt Template**:

```
Write a 1500-word SEO-optimized blog post.

Title: "[Target title]"

Secondary keywords: [related terms]

Word count: 1500-2000 words
```

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"You know that moment when you buy a greeting card and then stare at the blank inside, frozen? Prosepal fixes that. Pick the occasion - birthday, sympathy, thank you - pick your relationship and tone, add any personal details, and in 30 seconds you have three personalized messages ready to copy. It's like having a thoughtful friend who's great with words, in your pocket."

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I can just use ChatGPT" | "You can, but you'd need to explain the occasion, relationship, tone, and context every time. We've done that work for you." |
| "Isn't using AI cheating?" | "Is using spell-check cheating? The feelings are yours. We just help you express them." |
| "The messages will sound generic" | "That's why we ask for personal details. Add that your dad loves fishing and watch the magic." |
| "I only need this once a year" | "Most people write 8-12 cards a year. And the hardest ones - sympathy, difficult family - need help most." |

### Brand Voice

| Attribute | Yes | No |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Tone | Warm, helpful, slightly playful | Corporate, cold, preachy |
| Language | "You've got this" | "Leverage our platform" |
| Humor | Self-aware, relatable | Cheesy, forced |
| Empathy | "Cards are hard" | "You're doing it wrong" |

### Reinvestment Philosophy (Realistic)

**Rule**: Don't spend money you don't have. Max 30% of MRR on paid acquisition.

| MRR | Max Ad Spend | Keep (70%+) |
|-----|--------------|-------------|
| $500 | $0 (stay organic) | $500 |
| $1,000 | $300/mo | $700 |
| $2,000 | $600/mo | $1,400 |
| $5,000 | $1,500/mo | $3,500 |

**Bootstrapped reality**:
- First $1,000 MRR should come from organic (proves product-market fit)
- Paid ads amplify what's already working, they don't create demand
- Keep 70%+ margin until you have 6+ months runway in the bank
