# Prosepal Marketing Strategy

## The Problem

**6.5 billion greeting cards are purchased in the US annually.** Every single one needs a message.

The moment people dread isn't buying the card - it's opening it and staring at the blank space. "What do I write?" They know what they feel. They don't know how to say it.

Current solutions fail:
- **ChatGPT**: Requires prompt engineering ("Write a sympathy message for my aunt who lost her husband of 40 years, keep it warm but not religious...")
- **Grammarly**: Edits existing text, doesn't generate
- **Card design apps**: Beautiful images, empty message box

## The Market

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global greeting card market | $6-7 billion |
| Digital/online segment growth | 18% CAGR |
| Cards purchased annually (US) | 6.5 billion |
| Birthday cards share | 50%+ |
| Users preferring customizable | 58% |
| AI personalization growth | 39% YoY |

**Demographics**: Millennials are the largest card-buying generation. 63% of 18-35 year olds plan to send MORE cards, not fewer. They value authenticity and personal connection but want digital convenience.

## Prosepal's Position

**"Say what you mean. In seconds."**

We don't make cards. We write the message you wish you could.

## Target Audience

### Primary: "The Last-Minute Carers" (25-45)

- Buy card on the way to the event
- Care deeply, express poorly
- Time-starved professionals and parents
- Already comfortable with AI tools

**Trigger moments:**
- Standing in card aisle, card in hand, pen frozen
- Night before a birthday/event
- Sympathy situations (hardest to write)

### Secondary: "The Thoughtful Givers" (30-55)

- Send cards proactively
- Multiple occasions per month
- Value quality over speed
- Will pay for unlimited

## Seasonal Strategy

Card-giving follows predictable peaks:

| Month | Occasions | ASO Keywords |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Feb | Valentine's Day | valentine message, love card |
| May | Mother's Day | mother's day card message |
| Jun | Father's Day, Graduations, Weddings | graduation card, wedding wishes |
| Dec | Christmas, Holidays | christmas message, holiday card |
| Year-round | Birthdays, Thank You, Sympathy | birthday card message, condolence message |

**Strategy**: Update App Store keywords 2-3 weeks before each peak. Create occasion-specific screenshots.

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (AI message generators)

| App | Focus | Weakness |
|-----|-------|----------|
| GreetingCardWriter.com | Web-only messages | No app, generic UI |
| Wishbot | Card + message | Design-first, message secondary |
| Cardsy | Card + message | Subscription fatigue |

### Indirect Competitors

| Tool | Why people use it | Why they'd switch |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| ChatGPT | Free, powerful | Requires prompting skill |
| Google | "What to write in X card" | Generic results, no personalization |
| Nothing (wing it) | Free | Results show |

---

## Messaging Framework

### Headlines (A/B test)

1. "Never stare at a blank card again"
2. "The words you mean, written for you"
3. "AI that writes like you care"
4. "From blank card to perfect message in 30 seconds"

### App Store Description (Key Points)

- 40 occasions from birthdays to sympathy
- Personalized to your relationship
- 6 tones from heartfelt to humorous
- Add personal details for authentic messages
- No account required to try

### Social Proof Angles

- "Finally said what I meant to my dad"
- "Saved me at 3 funerals this year"
- "My thank-you cards actually sound like me now"

## Go-to-Market Priorities

### Phase 1: Organic Foundation (Now)

1. **ASO optimization** - Nail keywords for "greeting card message," occasion-specific terms
2. **App Store screenshots** - Show the flow, not features
3. **Ratings push** - Prompt after 3rd successful generation

### Phase 2: Content & Community (Month 2-3)

1. **TikTok/Reels** - "Watch me write a sympathy card in 30 seconds"
2. **Pinterest** - Occasion-specific message ideas (funnel to app)
3. **Reddit** - r/etiquette, r/relationships (genuine help, not spam)

### Phase 3: Paid Acquisition (Month 4+)

1. **Apple Search Ads** - Occasion keywords during peaks
2. **Meta** - Interest targeting: Hallmark, Papyrus, card lovers
3. **Influencer** - Lifestyle/organization creators
