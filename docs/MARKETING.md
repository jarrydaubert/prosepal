## 1. The Problem (Deep Dive)

### The Blank Card Moment

**6.5 billion greeting cards are purchased in the US annually.** Every single one needs a message.

The moment people dread isn't buying the card - it's opening it and staring at the blank space. "What do I write?" They know what they feel. They don't know how to say it.

### Why This Is Hard

Research on sympathy card writing reveals consistent anxiety patterns:

| Pain Point | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| "Don't know what to say" | Google: 110K+ monthly searches for "what to write in sympathy card" |
| Fear of clichés | Articles explicitly warn against "they're in a better place" |
| Cultural/religious sensitivity | Users anxious about assumptions |
| Relationship calibration | Different for coworker vs. close friend |
| Time pressure | Cards often written last-minute |

### The Sympathy Card Problem (Worst Case)

Sympathy cards represent the hardest writing challenge:
- Highest emotional stakes
- No room for generic messages
- Fear of saying the wrong thing
- Often needed urgently (funeral tomorrow)

**Quote from Hallmark**: "While there is no perfect message, expressing your support is crucial."

This is exactly where Prosepal shines - we remove the paralysis.

### Current Solutions Fail

| Solution | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Requires prompt engineering: "Write a sympathy message for my aunt who lost her husband of 40 years, keep it warm but not religious, mention his love of gardening..." |
| **Grammarly** | Edits existing text, doesn't generate from scratch |
| **Google** | Returns generic lists, no personalization |
| **Card design apps** | Beautiful images, empty message box |
| **Wing it** | Results show - recipients can tell |

## 2. Market Analysis

### Industry Size & Trends

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Global greeting card market | $6-7 billion | Intel Market Research 2025 |
| US market share | 35% (~$2.4B) | Intel Market Research |
| Cards purchased annually (US) | 6.5 billion | GiftLips 2026 |
| Physical card market CAGR | -2.5% (declining) | Intel Market Research |
| **Digital/online segment CAGR** | **+18.3%** | IBISWorld |
| Birthday cards share | 50%+ | Industry average |
| Hallmark + American Greetings | 85% market control | Intel Market Research |

### Key Insight: Physical Declining, Digital Exploding

The $6B physical card market is shrinking 2-3% annually. But online greeting services grew 18%+ CAGR over 5 years. **The message is separating from the medium.**

### Consumer Behavior Shifts

| Trend | Data Point |
|-------|------------|
| Customization demand | 58% of users prefer customizable e-cards |
| AI personalization growth | 39% YoY increase in AI personalization tool usage |
| Millennials buying MORE cards | 63% of 18-35 plan to send more cards this year |
| Digital fatigue driving physical | Younger generations returning to handwritten for authenticity |

### Why Millennials Saved The Industry

Contrary to predictions, millennials are the **largest card-buying generation**:

- Value authenticity and personal connection
- Experience "digital fatigue" - physical cards feel special
- Grew up both writing notes AND using digital tools
- Want convenience of digital with meaning of physical

**The gap**: They want to send meaningful cards but struggle with the message. They're digitally native enough to use AI but want it to feel personal.

## 6. Conversion & Monetization

### Industry Benchmarks (2025)

| Metric | Benchmark | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Install → Trial conversion | 10-20% | Statista |
| Trial → Paid conversion | 15-25% | RevenueCat |
| Direct paywall conversion | 2-5% | RevenueCat |
| Freemium → Paid | 0.7-4% | Various |
| Top 5% app first-year revenue | >$8,880 | RevenueCat |
| Bottom 25% first-year revenue | <$19 | RevenueCat |

### Prosepal Model: Freemium + Soft Paywall

**Free Tier**:
- 1 lifetime generation (no login)

- See the magic work

**Pro Tier** ($4.99/month or $29.99/year):
- 500 generations/month (effectively unlimited)
- History saved across devices
- No ads, priority support

### Why This Model

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 free generation | Must experience value before paywall |
| Not 3 free | Creates urgency after first "aha" moment |
| $4.99/month | Below "impulse" threshold, matches utility apps |
| $29.99/year | ~50% discount, strong annual incentive |
| 500/month limit | Effectively unlimited for individuals, prevents API abuse |

### Conversion Optimization Levers

1. **Day-0 Activation**: 82% of trial conversions happen on install day
2. **Immediate Value**: First generation must work flawlessly
3. **Friction Removal**: No signup required for first generation
4. **Price Psychology**: Monthly feels expensive, annual feels like a deal
5. **Timing**: Show paywall after first successful generation (proven value)

### Revenue Projections (Conservative)

| Scenario | Monthly Downloads | Conversion | MRR |
|----------|-------------------|------------|-----|
| Month 1 | 1,500 | 2% | $150 |
| Month 6 | 15,000 | 3.5% | $2,625 |
| Month 12 | 30,000 | 4% | $6,000 |

## 7. App Store Optimization (ASO)

### Why ASO Matters

- 70% of App Store users discover apps through search
- Screenshots are the #1 conversion factor after icon
- Keywords determine visibility for intent-based searches

### Keyword Strategy

#### Primary Keywords (High Intent)

| Keyword | Search Volume | Competition |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| "greeting card message" | Medium | Low |
| "what to write in card" | High | Low |
| "card message ideas" | Medium | Low |
| "sympathy message" | High | Medium |
| "birthday card message" | High | Medium |

#### Seasonal Keywords (Rotate 2-3 weeks before peak)

| Season | Keywords |
|--------|----------|
| February | valentine message, valentine card, love message |
| May | mothers day card, mom message, mothers day message |
| June | fathers day card, graduation message, wedding card message |
| November | thanksgiving message, thank you card |
| December | christmas card message, holiday wishes, new year message |

### App Title & Subtitle

**Title** (30 chars): `Prosepal - Card Messages`

**Subtitle** (30 chars): `AI Greeting Card Writer`

### Screenshot Strategy

Research shows the first 3 screenshots are critical - users rarely scroll.

| Screenshot | Content | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Hero shot: "Never stare at a blank card again" + phone showing completed message | Hook + promise |
| 2 | Occasion picker (40 options visible) | Breadth |
| 3 | Before/after: blank card → beautiful message | Transformation |
| 4 | Relationship + tone selectors | Personalization |
| 5 | 3 message variations | Choice/quality |
| 6 | One-tap copy | Speed |

**Design Principles**:
- Benefit-driven captions, not feature names
- High contrast, readable on small screens
- Show real UI (builds trust)
- Consistent visual language
- Device frames optional (mixed data on effectiveness)

### App Description Structure

```

"Saved me at 3 funerals this year" - App Store Review
```

### Ratings Strategy

**When to Prompt** (Apple's SKStoreReviewController):
- After 3rd successful generation (proven value)
- After copying a message (completed action)
- NOT during first session
- NOT after errors
- Max 3x per 365 days (Apple limit)

**Best Practices**:
- Time prompt after positive moment
- Never interrupt active task
- Use native prompt (required by Apple)
- Don't ask "Do you like our app?" first (against guidelines)

## 8. Content Marketing

### Platform Strategy

| Platform | Content Type | Goal | Frequency |
|----------|--------------|------|-----------|
| TikTok | Demo videos, relatable moments | Awareness, virality | 5-7x/week |
| Instagram Reels | Same as TikTok, cross-post | Awareness | 5-7x/week |
| Pinterest | Message idea pins, occasion boards | Discovery, SEO | 10-15 pins/week |
| Reddit | Genuine help, not promotion | Trust, long-tail | As relevant |

### TikTok/Reels Strategy (Primary)

**Why TikTok**:
- 766M+ daily active users
- Algorithm favors content quality over follower count
- New accounts can go viral
- Perfect for "before/after" transformation content

**Content Pillars**:

| Pillar | Example | Hook |
|--------|---------|------|
| **The Struggle** | "POV: You bought a sympathy card and now you're having an existential crisis" | Relatable pain |
| **The Speed Run** | "Writing a card message in 30 seconds (not clickbait)" | Proof of speed |
| **The Transformation** | "What I would have written vs. what AI wrote" | Quality comparison |
| **The Niche** | "When your coworker's dog dies and you don't know what to say" | Specific scenarios |
| **The Reaction** | "My mom's reaction to the message I wrote her" | Emotional payoff |

**Video Formula** (Research-Backed):
1. Hook in first 1-3 seconds (text overlay + movement)
2. Jump cuts to maintain pace
3. Show the app naturally (not forced)
4. End with result + soft CTA
5. 15-45 seconds optimal length

**Viral Triggers**:
- Duet/stitch opportunities
- Relatable situations
- "Wait for it" payoffs
- Emotional moments
- Controversial takes ("Hallmark cards are lazy")

### Pinterest Strategy

**Why Pinterest**:
- 537M monthly active users
- Users have HIGH purchase intent (70% more likely to buy)
- Content has long lifespan (60%+ of saves are 1+ year old pins)
- Functions as visual search engine

**Content Types**:

| Pin Type | Example | Call-to-Action |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Message collections | "20 Birthday Messages That Actually Sound Personal" | "Generate your own →" |
| Occasion guides | "What to Write in a Sympathy Card (Without Clichés)" | "Get personalized message →" |
| Relationship tips | "Thank You Messages for Every Relationship" | "Try Prosepal →" |
| Seasonal roundups | "Valentine's Day Messages That Don't Sound Cheesy" | "Download free →" |

**Board Structure**:
- Birthday Card Messages
- Thank You Card Ideas
- Sympathy & Condolence Messages
- Wedding & Anniversary Wishes
- Holiday Card Messages
- [Occasion] Card Ideas (for each occasion)

### Reddit Strategy

**Relevant Subreddits**:
- r/etiquette (266K members)
- r/relationships (8.7M members)
- r/socialskills (3.2M members)
- r/Advice (3.8M members)
- r/CasualConversation (1.8M members)

**Approach** (Critical - Reddit hates spam):
1. Find genuine "what do I write" posts
2. Provide helpful, specific advice
3. Mention Prosepal only if truly relevant
4. Build karma through genuine participation
5. Never astroturf or create fake posts

**Example Response**:
> "For a sympathy card, keep it simple and personal. Start with 'I'm so sorry for your loss,' mention something specific about the person if you can, and offer concrete support ('I'll bring dinner Thursday'). If you're really stuck, apps like Prosepal can help generate a starting point you can personalize."

<a name="retention"></a>
## 10. Retention & Engagement

### Why Retention Matters

- 30% of annual subscriptions cancel in Month 1
- Acquisition costs are rising; retention is cheaper
- Power users drive word-of-mouth

### Onboarding Optimization

**Research-Backed Principles**:
1. **Progressive disclosure**: Don't show everything at once
2. **Immediate value**: First generation must succeed
3. **Minimal friction**: No signup for first use
4. **Clear progress**: User knows where they are

**Prosepal Onboarding Flow**:

| Step | Screen | Goal |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Splash + one-liner | Set expectation |
| 2 | Occasion picker | Easy first choice |
| 3 | Relationship picker | Personalization begins |
| 4 | Tone selector | Control feeling |
| 5 | Details (optional) | Deeper personalization |
| 6 | Generation | Magic moment |
| 7 | Results | Deliver value |
| 8 | Copy | Complete action |
| 9 | (Post-success) Paywall | Convert |

**Key Metric**: Time to first successful copy < 60 seconds

### Retention Triggers

| Trigger | Timing | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Unused after install | Day 1 | Push: "Your first card message is waiting" |
| Single use then dormant | Day 3 | Push: "Thank someone today?" |
| Seasonal reminder | 2 weeks before holiday | Push: "[Holiday] cards coming up" |
| Birthday reminder | If enabled | Push: "[Name]'s birthday is tomorrow" |
| Streak recognition | After 3 uses | In-app: "You're getting good at this" |

### Push Notification Strategy

**Principles**:
- Value-driven, not nag-driven
- Tied to external events (holidays, birthdays)
- Respect opt-outs
- Test timing (evenings often best)

**Examples**:
- "Mother's Day is in 2 weeks. Get ahead of the card aisle panic."
- "Haven't thanked someone in a while? 30 seconds is all it takes."
- "Difficult card to write? We've helped with 10,000 sympathy messages."

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"You know that moment when you buy a greeting card and then stare at the blank inside, frozen? Prosepal fixes that. Pick the occasion - birthday, sympathy, thank you - pick your relationship and tone, add any personal details, and in 30 seconds you have three personalized messages ready to copy. It's like having a thoughtful friend who's great with words, in your pocket."

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I can just use ChatGPT" | "You can, but you'd need to explain the occasion, relationship, tone, and context every time. We've done that work for you." |
| "Isn't using AI cheating?" | "Is using spell-check cheating? The feelings are yours. We just help you express them." |
| "The messages will sound generic" | "That's why we ask for personal details. Add that your dad loves fishing and watch the magic." |
| "I only need this once a year" | "Most people write 8-12 cards a year. And the hardest ones - sympathy, difficult family - need help most." |

### Brand Voice

| Attribute | Yes | No |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Tone | Warm, helpful, slightly playful | Corporate, cold, preachy |
| Language | "You've got this" | "Leverage our platform" |
| Humor | Self-aware, relatable | Cheesy, forced |
| Empathy | "Cards are hard" | "You're doing it wrong" |

| **Referral program** | No viral loop currently - add shareable outputs with app watermark, referral incentives |
| **Increase paid test budgets** | $50-100/day may be too conservative for statistically significant ROAS data in 2026 market |
| **Platform diversification** | Heavy TikTok/Instagram reliance risks algorithm changes - add YouTube Shorts, expand Pinterest |

### Market Expansion

| Item | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| **Global data earlier** | Current stats are U.S.-centric - incorporate UK/EU/APAC market data before Month 7 |
| **Balance occasion messaging** | Sympathy emphasis may narrow perceived utility - highlight high-volume occasions (birthday, thank you) equally |
| **Quarterly competitor refresh** | AI landscape evolving fast - schedule updates to track Thankbox, Venngage, emerging tools |

### Retention Depth

| Item | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| **Email/SMS re-engagement** | No flows defined beyond push notifications |
| **Seasonal campaigns** | Tie push notifications to major holidays with countdown messaging |
| **Cohort-specific targets** | Add Pro conversion benchmarks by persona (Last-Minute Carer vs. Thoughtful Giver) |
