# Prosepal Docs Index

This folder holds canonical product, engineering, and operations docs for the mobile app.

## Core docs

1. `../README.md`
   - Root project overview and developer quick-start.
2. `../AGENTS.md`
   - Agent operating policy and local skill behavior.
3. `../SECURITY.md`
   - Security reporting and disclosure process.
4. `DEVOPS.md`
   - Single source of truth for DevOps, CI/CD, release operations, and rollback.
5. `NEXT_RELEASE_BRIEF.md`
   - Shareable release spec and sign-off scope.
6. `BACKLOG.md`
   - TODO-only backlog with explicit Definition of Done per item.
7. `IDENTITY_MAPPING.md`
   - Canonical identity mapping across Supabase, RevenueCat, Analytics, and Crashlytics.
8. `REMOTE_CONFIG.md`
   - Remote Config guardrails and runtime control policy.
9. `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Release execution and provider-console verification checklist.
10. `ARCHITECTURE.md`
    - System architecture, core modules, and integration boundaries.

## Working rules

1. Keep open work only in `BACKLOG.md` (no status/progress docs).
2. Keep operational process updates in `DEVOPS.md` in the same change.
3. Keep release scope and acceptance criteria aligned in `NEXT_RELEASE_BRIEF.md`.
4. Keep this index updated when canonical docs are added, renamed, or retired.
