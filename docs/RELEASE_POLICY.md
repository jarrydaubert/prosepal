# Release Policy

## Versioning Standard

- All production releases use Semantic Versioning with `v` prefix:
  - `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
  - Example: `v1.0.0`
- Ad-hoc tag names are not used for production releases.

## Release Execution

- Releases are created through GitHub Actions workflow:
  - Workflow: `Release`
  - Trigger: `workflow_dispatch`
  - Required input: semantic version without leading `v`
- The workflow:
  - validates semantic version format
  - creates and pushes annotated tag (`vX.Y.Z`)
  - publishes GitHub Release with autogenerated notes (`--generate-notes`)
  - uses `.github/release.yml` categories for note grouping

## Release Notes

- Every production release must have a GitHub Release entry.
- Release notes are autogenerated and can be edited post-publish for clarity.

## Repository Hardening Policy

- Keep current repository ruleset and Actions hardening unchanged unless explicitly reviewed:
  - PR required for `main`
  - required checks (`CodeQL`, `Flutter Quality Gate`)
  - strict status checks
  - force-push/delete blocked on `main`
  - linear history required
  - selected-actions + SHA pinning

## Approval Policy

- While single-maintainer: required approvals may remain `0`.
- If additional maintainers join: update branch protection/ruleset to require `1+` approving review before merge.
