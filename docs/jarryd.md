Jarryd's doc of requests and current focus:

1. we need to check the web landing page for SEO, sitemap, robot and llma (that new ai crawling file??)
2. what about landing page analytics? can we add to firebase or should we use GA4 and vercel analytics? 
3. we need to ensure we have unit, integration and e2e tests setup
